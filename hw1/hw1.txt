1a. #1, #4, and #8 are acceptable behaviors.
1b. #2, #3, #4, and #5 are recommended text editors. 
1c. #2 is the late submission policy.
1d. #2 is the correct protocol and #4 is helpful too. 

2a. Only #3, terminal, is an accepted git interface. 
2b. 
	1.   git add hw1q2b.cpp 
	2.   git log
2c. github would throw an error, because each commit must have a message associated with it, and 'git commit' does not specify a message.

3. It is possible to overwrite part of the buffer that the user still has access to as a result of how the function free_chars works. Because only the the pointer values in the function call are set to null, all possible pointers that point to locations further right on the memory stack than 'p' are still accessible. In hw1q6a as an example, if char* c1 were to be deleted, then all of the memory on the stack would be set to null, despite c2,c3,etc still being accessible and still pointing to addresses on the stack that no longer hold the values that were set to them.
